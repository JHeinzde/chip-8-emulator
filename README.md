# Introduction

Hi this is a simple chip-8 emulator, that served as a learning project for me. I implemented
it in C because I thought it would be a good fit. I did not need any big memory mgmt etc, so
the likelihood of failing was pretty low. It runs the test_opcode.ch8 rom from https://github.com/corax89/chip8-test-rom/blob/master/LICENSE
successfully.
